Whenever we do so-called data analysis, data is the biggest and the most important part of the whole process. Depending on the information it contains, it dictates overall direction of the upcoming analysis - it helps us to define concrete subgoals from a naive, indefinite project-oriented objectives; then it further determines which methodologies and algorithms need to be used in order to achieve the goals.

Important as such, data is more than just a gimmick for a project. If there is a huge discrepancy between the goal of the project and the actual information available in the data, we need to either step back and redirect the project or try to get new data that looks more promising.

I think this is the main reason why data analysis is not so straightforward. In project design phase, we have to determine deliverables that hold the key to the success of the project. But the project planning is usually done way before understanding how data looks like, so there is always conflict between what is planned in project design phase and what can be done in execution phase.

Despite such difficulty in data analysis, there are things you can do to make the process smoother. The key is to understand the entire pipeline specific to your domain - how data is collected, how they are stored, how they are delivered to data science team, and what is the expected form of output as the result of analysis. Data is very contextual. Without understanding the meaning of numbers, they are just arbitrary vectors. Without studying and learning the data source, you have no idea how much they are biased and thus how reliable they are. Without these information, data is in itself missing data. By definition, missing data is marginal and thus is misleading. So it is much more important to comprehend the whole picture of process rather than to wrestle with numbers which do not carry any insights by themselves.
