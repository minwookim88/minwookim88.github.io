In order to understand the nature of data, we first need to understand the concept of information and its relation with data. Information is subjective description that attempts to summarize contextual truth given the limited amount of description capacity. That is, information is truth conditional upon context, using probabilistic terminology. Information is mostly intangible, so there are two main problems in transferring information: 1. It easily deviates from the original meaning as it passes down to others because people tend to reinterpret the meaning (intentionally or unintentionally) as they deliver the information; 2. Because it is intangible, verbal communication is the only viable way to deliver information, but verbal communication does not allow large-scale propagation.

Data, on the other hand, is recorded information in a written form using numbers and letters. The key characteristics that differentiates data from information is sustainability. Thanks to the feature, data is more robust to deformation and is most suitable for massive propagation. Arguably, this could be construed as written data is more reliable source of knowledge than verbal information. I would say that it is only conditionally true.

Because data is recorded information, it requires someone (say, source of the data) who first observes truth and translates it into information through abstraction. Then, the source records the resulting abstracted information into written data. That means, data goes through additional step of abstraction. Let me explain this with a concrete example.
Suppose a researcher A wants to study the relationship between length of middle finger and stature. In order to expedite the study, he decides that he uses the data of middle finger lengths collected by someone else instead of collecting by himself. Then, he learns that one of his close colleagues, researcher B, has recently done a research using the same kind of data he collected himself. A is so excited by the fact that he can immediately start the research because he already has stature data he used in earlier research. He moves on to the next step immediately and finishes the work in no time.

Few days later, A decides to treat B in order to thank for providing data because he knows how it is painful to collect data. B suddenly pours out words and starts to explain how he struggled to create the dataset.

B: "I first started to measure finger length by myself. I decided to fly to Switzerland because my study was mainly about Europeans, and started wandering the streets to recruit European participants."

A: "Wait, was it all about European people? I thought it also included people from other parts of the world."

B: "No. the data does not contain any Asian or African people. Anyway, I started picking people randomly on streets and asked them for the participation to study. For those who accepted, I spent few seconds to measure the middle finger length, but damn, I was so unsure where finger actually starts. Is it the small knuckle bone that connects finger and back of hand? Or is it the palm-side fingerprint that bends and connects between finger and palm? I was so embarrassed that I couldn’t determine where to measure until like 20 people."

A: "What? So what did you do with those data?"

B: "They are all in the data. Oh, I forgot to mention it by the way. I had to tell that you’d better remove those data, but you looked in such a hurry that I forgot to tell you."

A: "..."

B: "Sorry. But you know, it
