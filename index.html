<p><h1>Thank you for visiting my blog.</h1></p>

<p>This is the place where I upload a variety of arbitrary <b>data-science</b>-related posts.
The topics range from thoughts on various aspects of data science, theories behind machine learning, example analysis using publicly-available real-world dataset, and hands-on tips for better data analysis.</p>

<p>Currently, I am working hard to complete the following grand objectives:
<ol>
  <li><b>Complete uploading posts</b> (about 50+ posts are pending).</li>
  <li><b>Add AI-powered plugins</b> (e.g. suggested readings) to this blog.</li>
  <li><b>Open up a YouTube channel</b> to upload fun music/games related video powered by AI (e.g. remixing songs, modeling AI-assisted Sims avatar).</li>
</ol>
Hope I am not too lazy to do all this.
</p>
Thank you!
