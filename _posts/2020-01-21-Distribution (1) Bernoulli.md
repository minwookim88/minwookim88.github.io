<b>Bernoulli distribution</b>
Bernoulli distribution is the simplest form of distribution of all distributions.

It models a space of random events where there is only two atomic events - 0 and 1.
More specifically, success failure.


An example would be $X=$

Bernoulli distribution is a special case of binomial distribution with $n=1$.
Conversely, a finite sum of $n$ independent Bernoulli distributions is equal to
binomial distribution with the number of trials equal to $n$, which can be formally proved by follwing MGF argument.
