Whenever we do so-called data analysis, data is the biggest and the most important component of the whole process. Depending on the information it contains, it shapes a direction of the analysis- it helps us to define concrete subgoals from a rather naive, indefinite project-oriented objectives; then it further determines which methodologies and algorithms need to be used in order to achieve the goal.

Important as such, data is more than just a gimmick for a project. If there is a huge discrepancy between the goal of the project and the actual information available in the data, we need to either step back and redirect the project or try to get the data that seems more aligned with the goal.

I think this is one of the main reason why data analysis is not so straightforward. In project design phase, we have to determine major deliverables that hold the key to the success of the project. But the project planning is usually done way before understanding data, so there is always conflict between what is planned and what can be achieved.

Despite the nature of the difficulty, there are things you can do to help you stand out amongst your peers. The key is to understand the entire workflow in your domain- how data is collected, how they are stored, how they are delivered to data science team, and what is the expected output from the project. This is because data is very contextual. Without knowing the meaning of the numbers, they are just arbitrary vectors. Without understanding the data source you have no idea how they are biased and whether they are accurate or not. Without these information, data is by itself missing data. By definition, missing data is marginal and is very misleading without proper conditional factors. So it is very important to deep-dive into the whole picture rather than wrestling with the numbers which alone have no meaning.
