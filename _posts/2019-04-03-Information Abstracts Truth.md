Information is an abstract concept that refers to the attempt to describe true nature of world. It refers to the summarized observation of the actual truth behind it. If someone asks me how the weather looks like in Santa Clara so I answer like "Bit dry because there is not much raining and mild in terms of temperature", it becomes information to him, but the information does not fully describe how frequently it rains and what the average temperature range in the region is.

If you ask what is the exact definition of truth, it becomes too philosophical and thus I wouldn’t be able to give a confident answer to it (nor do I want to because I want to avoid unnecessary arguments that are beyond the scope of the topic)

Then, what is truth? I wouldn't want to go too far as to defining what the exact definition is, because not only it is too philosophical and overwhelming so it is beyond my scope of knowledge, but also because the meaning is different in different fields. So, for the purpose of focusing on our domain, let us assume we all agreed that the truth means the way the world just looks like. From natural science's perspective, it is a collection of evidence that mirrors natual phenomena which is ready to be perceived, understood and processed by creatures who have capabilities to shape it into information (=informationalization) in their favor.

Informationalization is indispensable process to human being considering how curious creatures we are. However, your desire for knowledge can never be satisfied by yourself alone, because nobody can observe everything that is happening in the world, due to physical limitation of time and space. So, it is such desire and limitation that makes it so desperate for human to exchange information among themselves. People seek external sources of knowledge in order to learn more about truth from others rather than relying on themselves. People read news articles to get more information around the world which otherwise they cannot learn during their lifetime, and people exchange their knowledge with each other through everyday conversation.

In this respect, information, as the result of informationalization process, is contextual and subjective by nature. Information is abstraction of truth that is processed for purposes by individuals, and thus it is incomplete, imperfect, and subjective to the source of it. Abstraction is mandated by the fact that we cannot deliver everything we know through communication because of limited time and space. For this reason, information provider has to make decision as to what to provide and what to omit, which creates subjectivity nature and yields inaccurate truth representation as a consequence. Therefore, it can never be the same as the truth behind it. The following anecdotal example might be helpful in understanding the nature of information.

You've come to visit the Niagara Falls for the first time in life. You are so impressed by the magnificent view of falling water body, so you decide to brag about the amazing view to your friend, who had never been to the place before. You haven’t been able to see the other side of the falls but that’s ok, because this is the best time to make fun of him so you don’t want to miss it out. You give him a call, and start describing how the falls look like, without revealing the fact that you have not been able to see the other side of the falls as well.

> "I have never seen such a beautiful scenery before. A water body flows into the falls and water splashes onto downstream, which creates a fog-like vapor, but it is so huge in scale that makes it look like something supernatural going on, ..."

, while trying to carefully choose the right words and expressions to best impress him using exaggeration and fabrication sometimes, you know, so that he feels jealous of you. Despite your efforts, however, you realize that this dumb does not look like understanding the beauty of the nature I am enthusiastically describing, so you decide to send a picture of it instead. Few minutes later, he replies back, saying

> "Now I can see it is a water fall, but I still don’t know whether it is beautiful or not, nor is it big or not to be honest."

This dumb must be the worst person in the world who has some problem in his awful cognitive system. Cursing him this way, you text him saying, "Come and see it with your own naked eyes, you idiot."

It could be your friend's own awful sense of appreciation that makes him not able to appreciate the beauty of the fall, but how you feel about the object has nothing to do with the truth behind it. When you say "Niagara Falls is big", it is just an individual's abstracted description of the actual truth that the fall is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niagara_Falls#Characteristics" style="color:black">21~51m in height, and 320~790m in width</a>. Big is relative concept, so it only makes sense when you compare with other objects of the same kind. The statement that "Niagara Falls is big" is contextual and thus only makes sense when the comparison is implicitly being made only with other falls; not mountains. When you even say "Niaga Falls looks beautiful when the weather is clear", it might be useful information for travelers but still, it is individual's summarization and impression about the actual scenery that water particles create by reflecting light under strong sun rays in the absence of deflective clouds. More importantly, some people might feel it looks more beautiful when it is cloudy, so how is it close to the truth? Information abstracts truth, so it is contextual and subjective. It can never be identical to truth.

The importance of understanding the nature of information in data analysis lies in relation between information and data. Data is a recorded information in a written form using numbers and letters. This means that data is legible representation of information that follows some agreed level of standards. Understanding the nature of information and its relation with data thus helps us analyze data more accurately because data can never be understood correctly without understanding missing piece of truth that information introduces.
